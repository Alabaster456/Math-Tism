Math-Tism
=========

**Welcome**!

In this crazy, ground-breaking Math game, you have to choose your favorite arithmetic and then answer each question that is displayed on the screen with the number panel *through 1 and 9*! Not only does this game test your **knowledge in Math**, but it helps you to improve so that you can become an expert at any arithmetic! Are you ready? *Let's drive you* **Math-Tism**!

*NOTE*
------
This game remains unfinished for three reasons;

1. I didn't create a function that generated **random equations** for the user to answer with using the number panel (ALMOST FINISHED).
2. I didn't activate the other arithmetics (*only multiplication*).
3. I didn't implement sound. (COMPLETED) 


With this in mind, I need to do these things. But I'm willing to let any **programmer participate in this project** as an experience or learning improvement. So, you want to help? Just contact me at yazidnoned@hotmail.com.

If I don't manage to get back to you in time, please take consideration that I'm probably busy. But I will get back to you ASAP, no matter what. :)

Thank you, and happy coding!
